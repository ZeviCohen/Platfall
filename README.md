# Platfall
What is this game?
Platfall is a 2D two-player game created using Godot 4.

Brief Summary: 
The goal of a player is to compete against their opponent and reach the top of the screen before their opponent does. Helping them reach the top are some falling platforms(hence the name platfall) that can be controlled by the player's number keys. 

How does one control the platforms? 
Each platform corresponds with a number and pressing the key either freezes or unfreezes the platform in its location(depending on its previous state). For example, if a platform(labelled 3) is unfrozen and the player types the number 3, then the platform is now frozen in its place.

Any catches? 
If the player falls into the void or dies, he respawns back on his starting platform.

More Details: 
- The spawning platform moves along with the highest platform the player stood on. (Ex. if the player last stood on a platform in the middle of the screen before falling to a lower platform and then dying, he will be respawned in the middle of the screen).
- If a player happens to be standing on a platform and another platform lands on the player, the player is killed by the ensuing crush
